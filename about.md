# About

Youâ€™re welcome!

My name is Sideeg, and I work on developing digital tools for math and other STEM subjects.
I have extensive experience developing interactive calculations using JSON and performing data analysis with GA4 and Looker Studio. It's always exciting and rewarding to work on development projects and face new challenges.

Feel free to reach out or connect with me!
